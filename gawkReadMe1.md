## Teaching a Class on gawk
#### Overview of gawk
gawk (GNU awk) is a powerful programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. gawk is used to manipulate data files, text retrieval, and data processing tasks.

### Key Concepts and Commands
#### Basic Syntax

`gawk 'pattern { action }' file`

-	pattern: The condition to match.
-	action: The command to execute when the pattern matches.
-	file: The input file to process.

#### Basic Structure of gawk Script
gawk '
BEGIN { actions }
pattern { actions }
END { actions }
' file

-	**BEGIN Block**: Executes actions before processing any lines.
-	**Pattern-Action Block**: Executes actions for lines matching the pattern.
-	**END Block**: Executes actions after all lines have been processed.
2.	Common gawk Commands and Patterns

**Print**

`gawk '{ print $0 }' file.txt`

**Print Specific Field**

`gawk '{ print $1 }' file.txt`

**Prints the first field of each line.**

**Pattern Matching**
`gawk '/pattern/ { print $0 }' file.txt`

- Prints lines that match the pattern.

**Field Separator**
`gawk -F, '{ print $1 }' file.csv`

- Uses a comma as the field separator.

3.	Variables

**Built-in Variables:**

-	NR: Current record number.
-	NF: Number of fields in the current record.
-	FS: Field separator (default is whitespace).
-	OFS: Output field separator.
-	RS: Record separator.
-	ORS: Output record separator.

**User-defined Variables:**

gawk '{ total += $1 } END { print total }' file.txt

4.	Control Structures

**If Statements:**

`gawk '{ if ($1 > 100) print $1 }' file.txt`

**Loops:**

`gawk '{ for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) print $i }' file.txt`

### Example Exercises ###

- Print Entire File

`gawk '{ print $0 }' file.txt`

- Print Specific Field

`gawk '{ print $2 }' file.txt`

- Pattern Matching

`gawk '/error/ { print $0 }' log.txt`

- Print Line Number and Line

`gawk '{ print NR, $0 }' file.txt`

- Sum of a Column

`gawk '{ sum += $3 } END { print sum }' data.txt`

- Average of a Column

`gawk '{ sum += $3 } END { print sum/NR }' data.txt`

- Assignment

**Objective**: 

Use gawk to process and analyze data files, focusing on text manipulation, pattern matching, and data summarization.

1.	Task 1: Print Specific Fields
Extract and print the first and third fields of students.csv (fields separated by commas).
`gawk -F, '{ print $1, $3 }' students.csv`
2.	Task 2: Filter Lines by Pattern
Print lines from logs.txt that contain the word "ERROR".
`gawk '/ERROR/ { print $0 }' logs.txt`
3.	Task 3: Calculate Sum
Calculate the sum of the values in the second column of sales.txt.
`gawk '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }' sales.txt`
4.	Task 4: Calculate Average
Calculate the average value of the third column in data.txt.
`gawk '{ sum += $3 } END { print sum/NR }' data.txt`
5.	Task 5: Conditional Processing
Print lines from data.txt where the value in the first column is greater than 100.
`gawk '{ if ($1 > 100) print $0 }' data.txt`
6.	Task 6: Multi-line Records
Use gawk to process multi-line records in records.txt separated by blank lines.
`gawk 'BEGIN { RS = "" } { print $1, $3 }' records.txt`

This lesson plan and assignment will help students understand the basics of gawk and how to use it for various text and data processing tasks.
gawk (GNU Awk) is a powerful programming language and utility for pattern scanning and processing text files. Here are some common command line options for gawk:
1.	General Options:
o	-F <fs>: Specifies the input field separator fs (default is whitespace).
o	-f <file>: Specifies a file containing awk script.
o	-v var=value: Assigns a value to a variable var.
o	-W keyword: Enables various optional behaviors (posix, lint, compat).
2.	Execution Control:
o	-E: Exits after processing END rules.
o	-i <includefile>: Includes another awk source file.
o	-L <path>: Sets the library search path for awk libraries.
3.	Output Control:
o	-o: Specifies the output file (deprecated, use redirection instead).
o	-W outfile=<file>: Redirects print output to file.
4.	Input File Handling:
o	-: Reads input from standard input.
o	-F: Specifies the input field separator fs (default is whitespace).
o	-v var=value: Assigns a value to a variable var.
5.	Special Features:
o	-l <library>: Loads the awk library library.
o	-N: Disables all automatic printing of input lines.
6.	Debugging:
o	-d [opt]: Prints debugging messages.
7.	Help:
o	--help: Displays a brief help message.
o	--version: Displays the version information.
These are some of the most commonly used options with gawk. For more details and additional options, you can refer to the gawk manual (man gawk) or the GNU Awk User's Guide.
Examples
Example 1: Specifying Input Field Separator -F
# Suppose we have a CSV file with fields separated by commas
# Print the first field of each line using comma as the field separator
`gawk -F ',' '{print $1}' data.csv`
Example 2: Using an awk Script File -f
# Suppose we have an awk script in a file named `myscript.awk`
# Execute the script on a file `data.txt`
`gawk -f myscript.awk data.txt`
Example 3: Assigning Variables -v
# Calculate the square of a number using a variable assignment
`gawk -v num=5 'BEGIN { print "The square of", num, "is", num*num }'`
Example 4: Redirecting Output -W outfile=<file>
# Process a file and redirect output to another file
`gawk '{ print $2, $1 }' input.txt -W outfile=output.txt`
Example 5: Reading Input from Standard Input -
# Count the number of lines in a file using input from stdin
`cat data.txt | gawk '{ count++ } END { print "Total lines:", count }'`
Example 6: Enabling Specific Behaviors -W keyword
# Enable POSIX compatibility mode and process a file
`gawk -W posix '{ print "Hello, world!" }' data.txt`
Example 7: Debugging -d [opt]
# Debugging option to trace execution steps
`gawk -d 'all' '{ print $0 }' data.txt`
