look at bash script control structures
Bash provides several types of control structures for decision-making, loops, and conditional execution. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to the most commonly used Bash control structures:

1. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)

Bash uses the if statement to execute commands based on conditions.
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands if condition is true
elif [ another_condition ]; then
    # commands if another condition is true
else
    # commands if no condition is true
fi

#!/bin/bash

num=50

if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
elif [ $num -eq 5 ]; then
    echo "Number is equal to 5."
else
    echo "Number is less than 10."
fi

for var in list; do
    # commands
done

#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done


while [ condition ]; do
    # commands
done


#!/bin/bash

count=1

while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done

case $variable in
    pattern1)
        # commands for pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # commands for pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # default commands if no pattern matches
        ;;
esac

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a letter: " letter

case $letter in
    a)
        echo "You entered 'a'."
        ;;
    b)
        echo "You entered 'b'."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "You entered something else."
        ;;
esac


#!/bin/bash

greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "World"
